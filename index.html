			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="assets/img/apenachi.png">
			<p>Most people called me Alex. I'm father of two girls, both graduated the same year 2015. Violeta from college and Valeria from kindergarden. My interest in programming started when I was young, I meant really young and always enjoyed the pressure and challenges. They said it's never too late to learn I don't know about too old but I will keep trying. I also enjoy playing soccer during the weekends and watching a good movie when possible, is there is something that I might like as much as coding is going out and dance.</p>
